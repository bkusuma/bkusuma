🔭 **I just finished a data science bootcamp and currently:**
- Analyzing music lyrics
- Exploring full and part-time opportunities 
- Building cool things


🌱 **Some projects I'm excited to share:**
  1. My bootcamp capstone: lyrical genre [classification model](https://github.com/bkusuma/lyric-frequency-classifier)
     * Separates songs into top 10 genres based on lyric count vectors as input
  2. A [classification model](https://github.com/bkusuma/home-credit-default-risk) for Home Credit Group's Kaggle competition
     * Answers the question:  is a given applicant capable of repaying a loan?
  3. GitHub [template](https://github.com/bkusuma/kaggle-competition-template) aligning with Kaggle's own file structure
     * I created this for others to be able to use for Kaggle competitions

BTW did you know GitHub Flavored Markdown has footnotes? [^1]
