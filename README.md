# Hi there 👋🏾 I’m Bharat

## 👨🏾‍💻 Data Science Professional
### I'm a data scientist passionate about building models that solve real-world problems.

🔭 I just finished a data science bootcamp and currently:
- Analyzing music lyrics
- Exploring full and part-time opportunities 
- Building cool things

- 🌱 Some projects I'm excited to share:
  1. My bootcamp capstone: A [classifier](https://github.com/bkusuma/lyric-frequency-classifier) using lyric count vectors as input 
  2. A [classifier](https://github.com/bkusuma/home-credit-default-risk) for Home Credit Group's Kaggle competition asking is a given applicant capable of repaying a loan?
  3. GitHub [template](https://github.com/bkusuma/kaggle-competition-template) I created for others to be able to use for Kaggle competitions, aligning with Kaggle's own file structure

BTW did you know GitHub Flavored Markdown has footnotes? [^1]
